desc = [[Homs being the important city it is for the Syrians, it's no surprise the SAM presence there is high, that said, we identified an SA-3 site on the north east of the city, right by the Highway leaving the city. While not state of the art systems, they still pose a treat and should be dealt with carefully.

Primary objective: Eliminate the SA-3 site.

Threats: Medium altitude SAMs, AAA, SHORAD, and heavy CAP.

HARM code: 123

Recommended pilots: 2]]
