desc = [[A few minutes ago, the USS Hue City identified a pair of surface vessel south of Cyprus (in the WC quadrant) with its radar, and they are suspected to belong to the Syrian Navy. They are likely patroling known commercial routes in the region and scouting for submarines. The first reported location had the vessels at a bearing of 173, 79nm from Akrotiri.

Even with the halt of trade on the region, tankers and cargo ships still pass through that area, so for the safety of the non combatants, those ships must be disabled.

Be advised about Soviet activity on the area, while the Soviets are aligned to the Syrian government, they declared neutrality on the conflict. They maintain a naval base at Tartus and often send ships to patrol and escort their cargo vessels and tankers, but from Soviet information passed directly to the coalition, no ships should be present at that area today.

Primary Objective: Disable or sink both Syrian ships]]
